Privacy Policy for red-flag AI

Last Updated: 02/02/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how red-flag AI (referred to as "we," "us," or "our") handles your data when you use our mobile application ("the App"). Because the App does not require user accounts and does not use our servers for processing your data, this policy reflects our commitment to privacy with a focus on local processing and direct API interaction. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please read it carefully.

1. Information We Collect

We collect information from you in the following way:

Uploaded Content (Transient): The photos and text messages you upload to the App for analysis are directly and temporarily transmitted to Google's Gemini API for AI processing. We do not transmit any user data to our own servers.

Device Information (Limited): We collect limited information about the device you use to access the App, such as device type, operating system, and app version. This is used to ensure compatibility and for analytics in an aggregate form (not associated with specific files or users). This information is not used to personally identify users.

Usage Data (Limited and Aggregate): We collect very limited usage data in aggregate form about how the App is used (e.g., the number of times the analysis feature is used daily). This data is not tied to specific uploaded content or users and is completely anonymized.

Ad Data: Google AdMob may collect data about your device and usage patterns to serve personalized ads within the app. This may include device identifiers, browsing history, and app usage.

Important Notes:

No Server Involvement: We do not host or use any servers to process user data or store any user information, logs, or identifiers. Your data goes directly to the Gemini API and then directly back to your device.

No Account Creation: The App does not require or enable user accounts. We do not collect or store any personal information that can be used to identify you as an individual (such as name, email, or username).

No Persisted User Data: We do not store the uploaded content on any server after the analysis is complete. The analysis results are stored solely on your local device and never transmitted elsewhere. The analysis history stored in your app only contains the content generated by the Gemini API, no user-uploaded files are stored in the analysis history.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

Providing the App Service: To transmit your uploaded content directly to the Google Gemini API for analysis and to display the results to you within the app.

App Improvement: To monitor overall usage patterns and trends in aggregate (not connected to individuals or content) and to make general improvements in the performance and functionality of the App.

Displaying Advertisements: To serve personalized advertisements using Google AdMob.

Technical Compatibility: To maintain technical compatibility by tracking OS and version use in an aggregate manner.

3. How We Share Your Information

We share your information in the following limited ways:

Google Gemini API: The content you upload is directly transmitted to the Google Gemini API for AI processing. Google's data handling of the content transmitted is governed by Google's Privacy Policy, which can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy Please be aware that we do not control data retention or handling at Google using Gemini; therefore, you should review their policies directly.

Google AdMob: Google AdMob collects data to display personalized ads. Please refer to Google's AdMob privacy policy https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en for more details on their data collection and privacy practices. You may be able to control ad personalization within your device settings or Google account.

Limited Aggregate Data: We may share aggregate, anonymized data regarding usage with analytics providers to improve and monitor app usage. This data is not linked to individual users or uploaded content.

Important Notes on Uploaded Content:

Direct Transmission: The photos and text messages you upload are directly transmitted to Google's Gemini API for processing by their AI algorithms. We do not retain any user data on servers, since we do not use servers to process user data.

Local Storage of Analysis History: The results of the AI analysis (only the content generated by the Gemini API) are stored only on your local device as part of the analysis history. We do not access or store this analysis content. The analysis history contains only the content generated by the Gemini API, not your original uploads.

4. Data Security

Since we do not transmit data to our servers, we do not host or store any of your user content. Our data security focuses on ensuring:

Direct Connection to the API: When you transmit data, it goes directly to Google's servers to get the analysis and then is returned directly to your device for local storage.

Third-Party Security: Security measures for your data during transit are dependent on the security of your connection and Google's security protocols for their Gemini API. Please refer to Google's security documentation for more information.

5. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly process personal information of children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under the relevant age, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us immediately.

6. Your Rights

Because the App does not retain user accounts or personal data (beyond the limited device data), you have significantly limited direct rights concerning your information. However, you do have the following rights:

Access and Control over Your Data: You have complete control over the uploaded content and the analysis results, as it is stored only on your device. You may delete them at any time. You also have the ability to delete the analysis history generated by the Gemini API that is stored in the app.

Right to Information: You have the right to be informed about how we process data within this app. That is the purpose of this privacy policy.

Right to Opt-Out of Personalization: You may opt-out of ad personalization through your device settings or your Google account, where applicable.

GDPR/CCPA Considerations (Applicable to all Users):

Right to Access: While we do not store your content, you are entitled to contact us if you have questions about how the app operates.

Right to Erasure: Since we don't store personal data, there is nothing for us to erase beyond the limited technical data which we will erase if requested within legal boundaries.

7. In-App Purchases

red-flag AI offers in-app purchases that are processed through the Google Play Store platform. We do not collect or store any of your payment information directly. All purchase and payment information is handled by the respective app store. Please refer to the Google Play Store privacy policy https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US for more information.

8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated Privacy Policy on the App and notify you of any significant changes. Your continued use of the App after the changes take effect constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
